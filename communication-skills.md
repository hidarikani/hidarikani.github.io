# Social skills for software engineers

## Assertiveness
Basically there are 4 communication patterns. Try to avoid the first three:
1. Aggressive
2. Passive
3. Passive-Aggressive
4. Assertive

Examples:
- Product owner during sprint planning: __Do you commit to implementing feature X in the upcoming sprint?__ (for some reason the feature has incomplete requirements and the deadline is impossible)
- Aggressive: __You don't know what you're talking about! If you think it's possible then do it yourself!__ (shouting and waving)
- Passive: __Ok, yeah, I'll try.__ (avoiding eye contact, then secretly working overtime)
- Assertive: __I'm not sure how to implement feature X because it's missing some requirements, furthermore, I don't think it's doable in a sprint.__
- Passive-aggressive: __Sure, well do it, no problem!__ (smiling, then procrastinating until the sprint fails)
- Product owner during retro: Why did you fail the task?
- Passive-aggressive: What task? I don't remember committing to that! (lying)


## Explaining Complex Problems in a simple way
One way of doing it is coming up with [simple analogies](https://web.ccsu.edu/lego-se/publications/ITiCSE2018-LegoInterfacesAndIntegration.pdf).

## Making complex problems interesting
One way of doing it is practicing [storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling#In_business).

## Saying "no"
- Can you skip writing tests?
- No, because this would be unprofessional. Would you like more context?

## Saying "stop"
This one can be trickier because you say "yes" in the beginning but eventually yo're no longer satisfied with the situation:
- Let's have a two hour refinement session tomorrow at 10am.
- Agreed, I'll be there.
Next day 11:55am
- We still have some tasks to refine, let's extend the meeting to the lunch break.
- Stop, I am tired and would like to have lunch, so lets schedule another meeting.

## [Listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening)
Before a problem can be solved it has to be formulated.
- Count to 10 Mississippies before interrupting. It's difficult to formulate a complex problem, people might stop to think and then resume talking.
- Do not assume, ask for clarification. English isn't the best choice when describing algorithms, that's why programming languages were invented.
