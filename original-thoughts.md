# Original Thoughts

Recently I've been thinking, how many original thoughts do I have:

- I should refactor code all the time - heard it from an online lecture by Robert C. Martin
- I should discard old shirts - suggested by girlfriend
- Russia is likely to invade Ukraine - read in the local news
- We should check on the garden this weekend - suggested by parents
- I must implement feature X in app Y - told by product owner at work

So how many ORIGINAL thoughts do I ACTUALLY have, that are not linked to:
- Family?
- Work?
- Friends?
- Social Media?
- Influencers?
- Corporate thought leadership?

More importantly, how many sad, angry, anxious thoughts do I have which are NOT original?
Thoughts are highly contagious, like COVID. A new word was even invented to describe "viral" ideas: meme.
How many memes did I see today? How many of those memes were ironic, sarcastic, violent?
Even the topic for this post - not having many original thoughts - I head it from a podcast :D
